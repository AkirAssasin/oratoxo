# Oratoxo
ώρα τόξο - "time bow"

# Mechanics
Time moves only when you move your mouse - roguelike

10 arrows to survive - pick up the arrows you shot

Day and night influences monster behavior - nightspawns run away at morning

Instadeath

The further your mouse, the faster you move but you reload arrows slower

Get a double kill to shoot two arrows at once for one time, etc.
